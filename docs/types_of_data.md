# Data types

Rust Script has the following data types;
- Boolean
   - true
   - false (none, null, 0)
- Integer (Number)
- String
- Function

All of these data types can be assiged to a variable, which they can later be used. Look at variables.md for more info on variables.

Go see other files in the docs or the [Examples](https://github.com/calvin-smith1/Rusted-Script/tree/master/examples) for other ways of using the math functions in Rusted Script.
